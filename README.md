Python 3D Viewer
================

A simple starter Python code for experimenting 3D graphics using [glfw](https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/pyGLFW), [moderngl](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io) and [imgui](https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io).

The squeleton of an application using this template looks like:

```python
class MyApp(App):
    def init(self):
    	"""Load shaders, meshes, etc."""
        # ...

    def update(self, time, delta_time):
    	"""Update scene"""
        # ...

    def render(self):
    	"""Use modergl to draw 3d here"""
        # ...

    def ui(self):
        """Use the imgui module here to draw the UI"""
        # ...

    def on_key(self, key, scancode, action, mods):
    	"""React to user input"""
        # ...

    def on_mouse_move(self, x, y):
        # ...

    def on_mouse_button(self, button, action, mods):
        # ...

    def on_scroll(self, x, y):
        # ...

    def on_resize(self, width, height):
        # ...

app = MyApp(1280, 720, "My 3D application")
app.main_loop()
```
